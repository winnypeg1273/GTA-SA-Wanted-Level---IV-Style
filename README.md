# GTA SA - IV Style Wanted Levels
This mod will implement GTA IV's police response in GTA San Andreas

## Installation
* Install Modloader & CLEO
* Download and extract
* Move the Wanted Levels folder to the modloader folder
* Go inside it and create a new folder named "cleo"
* Move all the files from other original folders into the "cleo" folder
* Delete the original folders

## How The New Wanted Level Works
This mod alters police response in GTA SA to be more like GTA IV:
* 1-3 stars are basically the same with some minor changes
  * Aiming at cops will guarantee 2 stars instead of 1, and 3 stars if the officer is killed
  * Aiming at a civilian in sight of a cop guarantees 1 star, and 2 stars for shooting them in the sight of a cop
  * You may get a wanted level from climbing on the top of a patrolling police car
  * At 3 stars an officer may spawn ahead and deploy his spike strip to stop your vehicle
* 4 stars: either SWAT or the FBI will come after the player.
  * If SWAT is pursuing you and the wanted level is cleared in any way, or you are defeated by the cops, the next time you get 4 stars or more, you will instead encounter the FBI. And vice versa.
* 5 stars: police drives more aggressively and begins to shoot at you from their cars (also known as drive-by)
  * If SWAT is after you, instead of the regular police helicopter, you will encounter two Raindance helicopters painted in black (to look like GTA IV's Annihilator). 4 SWAT members will shoot at you in the air with their submachine gun.
  * In certain places, a SWAT member will spawn on top of one of the buildings with a sniper rifle.
* 6 stars: the military won't come after you. Instead you will only see either FBI or SWAT like before. However, now they all use the military's M4 rifles as weapons. This actually makes the game harder as the FBI/SWAT teams are much more numerous than the soldiers at 6 stars in vanilla.

## Other features
* The tank has also been nerfed so that it may take a little damage from nearby explosions. Be mindful when you shoot the cannon or crush cars.
* When the tank's HP gets to the lower half, it will emit smoke and the engine will stop for a few seconds after firing the cannon.
